# Image Segmentation with PyTorch and U-Net

This project implements a **binary image segmentation** model using PyTorch and the `segmentation_models_pytorch` library. The model is built on the **U-Net architecture**, leveraging pretrained encoders like EfficientNet, and is designed to classify each pixel of an image as either foreground or background.

## Project Overview

### 1. **Environment Setup**
   - Configured in **Google Colab** with GPU support for faster training.
   - Dependencies:
     - `segmentation_models_pytorch`: Pretrained segmentation models such as U-Net.
     - `albumentations`: A fast image augmentation library for transforming input images.
     - `opencv-contrib-python`: For image processing and handling operations.

### 2. **Dataset Handling**
   - The dataset is downloaded from a provided external source.
   - **Preprocessing**: Images are augmented using the Albumentations library, which includes transformations like rotations, flips, and scaling to enhance the model's robustness.

### 3. **Model Architecture**
   - **U-Net**: A widely used convolutional neural network for biomedical image segmentation. U-Net consists of an encoder-decoder structure:
     - **Encoder**: Pretrained on ImageNet, configurable via `segmentation_models_pytorch` (e.g., EfficientNet).
     - **Decoder**: Upsamples the feature maps to the original image size, making pixel-wise predictions.
   - **Binary Segmentation**: The model predicts one class (foreground vs. background) per pixel.

### 4. **Training Pipeline**
   - **Custom Training Loop** (`train_fn`):
     - **Input**: Batches of images and masks.
     - **Loss Function**: A combination of:
       - **Dice Loss**: Measures overlap between predicted and true masks.
       - **Binary Cross-Entropy Loss** (BCE): Pixel-wise classification loss.
     - **Optimizer**: Performs backpropagation and updates model weights.
   - **Performance Monitoring**: The loss is accumulated and averaged for each batch to track model performance.

### 5. **Evaluation Process**
   - **Validation Function** (`eval_fn`):
     - The model is set to evaluation mode (`model.eval()`), disabling dropout and batch normalization updates.
     - **Metrics**: 
       - **Validation Loss**: Evaluates the same combined loss (Dice + BCE) used during training.
       - **Dice Score**: A metric that captures segmentation accuracy by measuring the overlap between predicted and actual masks.
     - **No Gradients**: During evaluation, gradients are disabled with `torch.no_grad()` to save memory and speed up computations.

### 6. **Model Checkpointing**
   - After each epoch, the model is evaluated on the validation set.
   - The model with the lowest validation loss is saved as the "best model" using `torch.save()`, ensuring the best-performing version is preserved.

### 7. **Training and Validation Loop**
   - The training and evaluation processes are repeated over multiple epochs.
   - After each epoch, both **training loss** and **validation loss** are logged, along with metrics like Dice score to assess progress.

## Tools and Libraries
- **PyTorch**: Core deep learning framework for building and training neural networks.
- **segmentation_models_pytorch**: Provides various segmentation models with pretrained encoders.
- **Albumentations**: Data augmentation library to enhance input diversity during training.
- **OpenCV**: For image reading and processing.

## Potential Enhancements
- **Mixed Precision Training**: Using `torch.cuda.amp` for faster training on GPUs.
- **Additional Metrics**: Incorporate metrics like IoU (Intersection over Union) or Pixel Accuracy for more comprehensive evaluation.
- **Multi-Class Segmentation**: Extend the model to handle multi-class segmentation problems by modifying the number of output classes and adjusting the loss function.

## Conclusion
This project offers a modular and flexible framework for binary image segmentation tasks using U-Net. With configurable encoders and strong data augmentation techniques, it can be adapted for various domains, including medical imaging, satellite image analysis, and more.
